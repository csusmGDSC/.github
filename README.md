Hey! This is the GDSC project space. <br /> 
The team here works towards community enhancing projects!

### Current Project
To enhance ease of faciliation and engagement across all our branches (Leetcode/Network/Project) the team is developing a platform for GDSC @CSUSM. You can checkout our "website" repository README.md to get more info on the features we are developing.

### For New Members
Welcome! <br /> We're glad to have you and look forward to your contributions.  All we expect from contributors is a willingness to learn and solve problems.  To start getting involved we recommend that you checkout active repositories and read their README.md to gather all information about that project including how to start contributing code!
